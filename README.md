# GPXFollow
GPX Follow, a simple test with Leaflet and GPX files. It loads two GPX files and follow the route with popups where show simple information. The code works with markers and popup. 

It's only a stupid test, i did it only for learning proposes. 

This project uses:
 * GPX Files, exported from Strava.
 * a modified [Leaflet-GPX](https://github.com/mpetazzoni/leaflet-gpx) version with timestamps added.
 * [Leaflet 1.0](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet)

Work in progress.
